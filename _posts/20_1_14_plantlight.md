I have been trying to grow plants in my balcony in Bangalore but often I have realised that maybe they are not getting appropriate sunlight through the day, week, month and year if they survive. A simple approach could have been to make some observations about sunlight profile in my balcony on different times and days. But me being a lazy techie guy, I took to a scientific grounding behind what would be the most optimal way of arranging plants on your home balcony.
