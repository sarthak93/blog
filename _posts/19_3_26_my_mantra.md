It is human to be down in the dumps when life kicks you in the stomach and throws you beneath where you are. To be honest, these are real self-calibration random events that one should be thankful for to get. Without these, you will always stay the course of only the upside ride and that could very well be a tangent away from what you were meant to be doing. Mantra by literal definition means "a set of words that a person repeats while meditating to reinforce and express one's own basic beliefs". I go by the power of beleiving in the optimistic approach and that gets me through my ups and downs. I like to believe that everything happens for a higher order reason. Once I let this sink in as my basic belief, I am at peace to never attribute any success or failure to myself. It allows me to be free from any expectations of expressing joy or sadness and simply lets me be driven towards action and achieving outcomes while pushing on through life. So when you are feeling like someone gave you a kick in the stomach, go find that one belief that lets you get free from the emotion of it and gets you back on track to where you missed the course.
