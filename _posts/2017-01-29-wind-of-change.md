Bring about the change you want to see is what most say when we have heated discussions with ailments in an existing system. Captured in a web of an exisiting system, it is in the human nature to revolt and bring about a transition in how things are done. This is what we label as evolution and bringing about a change in how things are done. Over the millions of years of human existence, we pick up how things are given to us. Some of us, born with a curious outlook, tend to question the way of conducting things and some of us with a rather easy take on life, submit to it.
