## Credit statements

### Analysing your credit card usage non-intrusively

I am big on keeping track of where and what you spend on but so many applications out there achieve the same person; but you always run the risk of being profiled for the expenses you have made by folks other than your bank. Out of a need to do this analysis in the most crude form, I took to automating the PDF credit card statements I receive in my email to be summarised in a spreadsheet. It has been rather shocking to see the inherent expenditure differences between credit and debit cards. You would be surprised how much a leading or lagging indicator can contribute to your financial decision making.
