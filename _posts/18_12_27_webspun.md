Anger, frustration, despair - all are instruments of a helpless mind. The negation in your positivity defines your state of well being and leads you into the blackhole of sadness. But how do you get there? It is the build up of your very own mind that holds you a prisoner in the shackles of the realms of society. Look beyond these and you will unlock your true potential to transcend across worldly constraints and realise your true one purpose. One must never lose sight of that directive because that is what propels you forward in life through darkness and light alike. Stay focused and stay hungry. Don't become a prisoner of your own mind.
