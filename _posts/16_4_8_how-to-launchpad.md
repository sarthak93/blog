I struggled on the internet to figure out how to mark my presence online and beacuse I believe in open source, I thus would like to share a quick step-by-step guide to launch yourself in the wide world of wonder. P.S. No money needed, but if you feel too generous, I won't mind some charity coming along. 

### GitHub

* Go to [Github](https://github.com) and create an account using your email id.  
* Chose a username which wouldn't embarass you while sharing it.  
* Create a repository by the name of _**username**.github.io_
* Voila! Now you have a website serving you at http://**username**.github.io

### The crucial part - _The Web Page_

* Here is the nitty gritty stuff. 
	* You have to decide on the level of sophistication you need. _I am using an HTML/CSS based website with [Hugo](www.gohugo.io) powered blog._  
* Go over to some common free templating sites like [this](https://opendesigns.org) and download any one which suits you.  
* Download the entire package and make sure you can open it in a local web browser without internet.

### Getting published
* Now what you want to be doing is making a folder on your local machine where you could put the website locally.  
* If you are not familiar with Github command line, no worries, I've got you covered. As I said, this is for noobs like me. So go ahead and install [GitHub client](https://desktop.github.com) on your computer.  
* Link the aforementioned folder to the GitHub client. Add your GitHub credentials aka your username, password.  
* Now know that the words _pull_, _push_ and _commit_ would be redefined in your mental dictionary in the next few seconds.  
	* Commit - It means that the currently _watched_ folder is checked for changes and they are updated into a _version control_.  
	* Pull - It means that the changes in your remote repository aka folder would be reflected in your local repository.  
	* Push - It means that the changes in your local repository aka folder would be reflected into the remote repository.  
* Once you successfully _push_ the template folder to your _username.github.io_ repository, you have a live website.  
* Congratulations! :) You cleared the first step. Now head over to edit this template website to suit your needs. 


### Domain Name (If you're a fancy buff and want to brand yourself)

* Go over to any of the domain name services. _I chose [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)._  
* Choose a domain name you like and purchase it if it fits your budget.  
* Now head over to the DNS settings and add a _forward with masking_ to your live website at the aforementioned link.
