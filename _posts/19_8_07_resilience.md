What is resilience? the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. My engineering mindset makes me think of it as a personal Young's modulus. Simply put it is a function of your own toughness and your capacity really just like any other physical object. It allows you to bear a function of stress till a point where you can recover. Once you exhaust this so called pool of resilience, you are basically beyond the spring back realm and would end up with some permanent damage. Know what it implies for you personally. We are all human and it is imperative for us to know and realize that we have limitations and boundaries, be it physical, emotional or spiritual. This is contrary to breaking the shackles of your mind to free yourself from your mind but this is the realist in me penning down the experience of having gone beyond resilience and recovering. Everytime you pull something off like that, you toughen a little bit of yourself and it is a slow tempering process. So however it may make sense, always strive to know you are in control of the external forces acting upon you causing all the stresses in the system. Part of it will spring back, part of it will toughen you and maybe some of it will damage you. But the best part is that once you know what are the boundary conditions, you are limitless by definition.
