## Thesis writing
### Pointers for keeping it simple and sleek

Hey reader! Now that you're already reading this I should warn you that this requires you to get out of the comfort zone and not use conventional typesetting software. Perks of why you should do this is, that at a later point of time, it would be easier for you to publish papers in any format you like without having to jump around using those sloppy templates. 

### The Template

* Download this Latex template [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3agxwl90qhkowan/IITKGP_Thesis.zip?dl=0).
* Sorry folks! But I am a big fan of _Latex_ and would really suggest you use it as well. 
* Simply download any of the Tex packages suitable for your OS. 
* Expand this file and _Voila!_ You are ready to be making an awesome thesis. 

### The guidelines to adopt

* Documentation process is a difficult and tiresome process but if you start early, it will pay you well later. 
* Generally keep a thread in your documentation for the reader to be hooked on to.
	* Start with an introduction
	* Unfold all topics covered in that heading
	* Conclude the chapter
* Structure all your data in tables and figures clearly. Don't try and add too many figures lest you may be harrowed over _"less content, more pictures"_

For now, this is all. Feel free to get in touch. 

Cheers!
