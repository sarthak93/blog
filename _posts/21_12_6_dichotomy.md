I didn't want to be cruel to my plants and leave them without adequate water supply before locking my house for an extended period. So I took to the advent of combining simple relays and piping system with a water supply to create an automatic plant watering system. Now, my plants get watered for 5 minutes every Monday and Thursday morning without fail. Obviously, the big requirements here are water and electricity supply. I bought a drip irrigation system off the internet and set it up in a leak proof system allowing a tap to water the plants adequately. What I needed to do next is actuate the water supply by a controllable valve. So I used an AC solenoid normally closed valve to do the trick. This little wonder allowed me to simply turn on the electrical socket to let the water flow to the plants. Next I used a relay timer that I programmed to turn on and off at a particular day and time to do the switching on/off deed. Voila! There I had a solution to myself to let me be at peace that my plants will be watered while I am away.
