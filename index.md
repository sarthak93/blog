Hey there! I am Sarthak Jain, a civil engineering graduate from IIT Kharagpur. Currently, I am working with Shell building mega projects. 

I want to credit a fellow Github user for an easy [DIY blog setup guide](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).

My main motive is to share my views, thoughts and activities I keep doing at work and in life. 

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [contact me](sarthakjain939@gmail.com)

Thanks for reading!
